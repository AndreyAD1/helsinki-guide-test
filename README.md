# helsinki-guide-test
This repository contains UI tests for [a Helsinki Guide bot](https://github.com/AndreyAD1/helsinki-guide).

# Project Goals
Since the Helsinki Guide bot has quite diverse interface, end-to-end tests are useful.
Moreover, this project nicely helps me refresh and refine my Robot Framework and Selenium skills.

1. Install Python 3.12 or newer.
2. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

4. Open the downloaded directory in your terminal and install project dependencies 
(please consider using [a virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
